### I just wanna say...

Hugo is pretty great. I don't do very much coding in Go at the moment, but how crazy simple it was to set this site up really makes me want to.

### Going Forward...

I'm gonna write about my thoughts here, regarding things I'm interested in learning about and doing (like for work). Topics ranging from data science, machine learning, writing, to...whatever else.

Seriously check out [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) though if you haven't yet and you're in the market for a blog(ging framework).
