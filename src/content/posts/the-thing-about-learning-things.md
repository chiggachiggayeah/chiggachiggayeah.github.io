## Learning

I'm not a member of the educational anarchist school of thought that feels like education writ-large as an institution is awful, and dysnfunctional, and people who are *actually* smart needn't/shouldn't deal with any of it. I think that kind of thinking is too unuanced. I will say however that in general, I think schools do a very poor job of teaching their students *how* to learn. Learning how to learn is the quasi-joke answer people give when they're telling someone what college is supposed to do, either that or some ultra-cynical spiel about making connections or somesuch. However, *how* to learn is not an explicit part of most students' education. The question of how exactly to go about learning is one that I've been thinking about a lot lately, especially as I've discovered an interest in statisctics/machine learning/data and a desire to veer in that direction in terms of a job.

In particular I'm thinking about an idea I read while working through the book ThinkingBayes. It's one of the author's ideas about effective learning, and maybe it's common knowledge, but actually experiencing the idea in action, I wonder if the pool of possible applications isn't staggeringly vast.
